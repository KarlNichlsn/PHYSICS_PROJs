## 2D Ising Model Investigation 

Using the metropolis algorithm, the 2D Ising model was investigated. This model is a classical model in which each lattice site can be either spin up or spin down. The impact of spin flips are found using metropolis.

In looking at the temperature dependence of average magentisation (per site), the transition between a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase is evident at the critical temperature of ~2.4 Kelvin (Â±0.1K).

Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity increase with lattice size, whereas specific heat capacity levels off at a size of ~18, and may even reduce.

The large scatter is due to not enough metropolis sweeps
