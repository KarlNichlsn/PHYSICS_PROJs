A short jupyter notebook which introduced the radial velocity and transit technique for detecting exoplanets.

The generalised radial velocity technique follows after the derivation of semi amplitude, eccentric anomaly, true anomaly and radial velocity mainly from [Hara](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00701) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AnRSA..10..623H/abstract).  Along with lecture notes and [The Exoplanet Handbook](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011exha.book.....P/abstract) by Perryman.
