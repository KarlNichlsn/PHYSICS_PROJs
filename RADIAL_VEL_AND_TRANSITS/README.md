A short jupyter notebook which introduced the radial velocity and transit technique for detecting exoplanets.

The generalised radial velocity technique follows after the derivation of semi amplitude, eccentric anomaly, true anomaly and radial velocity mainly from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00701) or [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AnRSA..10..623H/abstract). (Hara N. C. & Ford E. B. (2023) *"Statistical Methods for Exoplanet Detection with Radial Velocities"*, Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application, vol. 10, issue 1, pp. 623-649.). Along with lecture notes and [The Exoplanet Handbook](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011exha.book.....P/abstract) by Perryman. (Perryman, Michael. (2011) *"The Exoplanet Handbook"* 2nd edn. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.)
