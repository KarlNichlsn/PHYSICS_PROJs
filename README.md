Various Physics &amp; Astrophysics Projects 

Most of these were code used for analysis as part of my undergraduate degree in Physics & Astrophysics, and as such may be in a strange format due to an assignment (only using jupyter notebooks for example). They are likely not polished, however I may go back and further them and their investigations, or fix them up.
