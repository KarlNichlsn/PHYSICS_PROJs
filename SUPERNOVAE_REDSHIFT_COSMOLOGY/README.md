7 SNe investigated, finding their redshift from spectra, peak apparent magnitude, and their luminosity decline relation (for correction). Hubble-Lemaitre diagram created. 
The Joint Light Curve Analysis [dataset](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...568A..22B/abstract) was used to investigate 3 cosmological models massless, only matter and 30% matter 70% dark energy. Lambda CDM was best fit.
